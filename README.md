Since this inherits a lot from `cpoly.f90` and `cpoly.f90` in turn is an update of the original code from CACM 419, I'm afraid that it may be subject to the [ACM Software License Agreement](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/softwarecrnotice) which, in short, grants to you a royalty-free, nonexclusive right to execute, copy, modify and distribute both the binary and source code solely for academic, research and other similar noncommercial uses. :(
